## ADA Directional Message Identifier

### Introduction
As part of ADA integration we need to avoid any directional messages such as click here, click above, see below, refer left section etc.. The intention is to not to create confusion to visually challenged person.

### Complication
We do have ADA evaluation tools such as HTML Code Sniffer, ANDI, WAVE and licensed tools such as Level access. But sadly, they wonâ€™t detect the directional messages

### Solution
We have a direction to remediate unwanted directional messages. We just need to bookmark and apply that to scan the page which will highlight the issues.
